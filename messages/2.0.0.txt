New Technique for Formatting Text
----------------------------------

The "Build System" has been removed as it was a bit buggy and strange.

Instead, format a file to JavaScript Standard Style by doing one of the following:

    - open the [Command Palette][cmd] and type:
        Format: JavaScript Standard Style

    - Use the default shortcut: `ctrl+alt+f`

If the shortcut is already mapped or you wish to have a different key mapped:
    - open Preferences > Key Bindings (User) and map a key to the `standard_format` command:

{ "keys": ["ctrl+alt+f"], "command": "standard_format", "context": [{"key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.js,source.json"}] },

NOTE: be sure to install standard and standard-format:

npm install -g standard standard-format
