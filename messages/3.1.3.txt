SublimeLinter-contrib-standard
-------------------------------

3.1.2

- Remove the default setting to disable the linter if standard is not a project
  dependency.

  If you would like to only lint projects where standard is a dependency there
  is a new setting "disable_if_not_dependency" which you can set to true.
